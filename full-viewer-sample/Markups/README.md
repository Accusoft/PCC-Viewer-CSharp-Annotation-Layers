`/Markups` folder
=============
This folder may be used to store markup XML files generated by the PCC viewer web tier when markup layers are turned off.
In the PCC viewer samples, the markup folder used by the web tier(s) is set in the
pcc.config files. Specifically, it is set with the XML element `<MarkupsPath>`. The web
tier may read and write markup XML to this folder.

*Note: Ensure that the web server process can read and write to this directory.*
